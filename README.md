# Midbox
I guess I am making my own mod in beepbox. Here is the beta release, or V0.0.1.
The mod so far does not plan to go in any direction, but I want to expand beepbox a bit in a few questionable places.
The name is Midbox. I know, dull name. I'll find a good name sometime in the future. I'll also attempt to make a logo for it if I can.
## Changelog
### V0.0.1
Added Keys for octaves one higher and lower.
Added 3 unisons. Deep Shift, Peak, and Hyper.
Lessened a few limits in Beepbox. These include tempo, beats per bar, song length, and etc. Most of these settings will match with Ultrabox.
Added the "Modbox Trill" transition effect as an envelope.
