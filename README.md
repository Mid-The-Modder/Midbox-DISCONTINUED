# Midbox
I guess I am making my own mod in beepbox. Here is the beta release, or V0.0.3.
The mod so far does not plan to go in any direction, but I want to expand beepbox a bit in a few questionable places.
The name is Midbox.

### Known Issues
New envelopes sound terrible when combined with certain settings, like pulse width.
## Changelog
