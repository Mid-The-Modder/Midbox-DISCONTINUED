# Midbox
I guess I am making my own mod in beepbox. Here is the beta release, or V0.
The mod so far does not plan to go in any direction, but I want to expand beepbox a bit in a few questionable places.
The name is Midbox. I know, dull name. I'll find a good name sometime in the future. I'll also attempt to make a logo for it if I can.
