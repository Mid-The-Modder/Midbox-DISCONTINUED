# Midbox
I guess I am making my own mod in beepbox. Here is the beta release, or V0.0.3.
The mod so far does not plan to go in any direction, but I want to expand beepbox a bit in a few questionable places.
The name is Midbox.

### Known Issues
"Modbox Blip" envelope sounds terrible when combined with certain settings, like pulse width.
Version displayed doesn't lead to correct URL.
Song player is nonfunctional.
Beepbox introduction is nonexistent.
## Changelog
### V0.0.1
Added Keys for octaves one higher and lower.
Added 3 unisons. Deep Shift, Peak, and Hyper.
Lessened a few limits in Beepbox. These include tempo, beats per bar, song length, and etc. Most of these settings will match with Ultrabox.
Added the "Modbox Trill" transition effect as an envelope.

### V0.0.2
Added multiple new chip waves. 1/6 pulse, 1/12 pulse, 1/16 pulse, and test.
Two new unisons. Broke and Vary.
Added the "Modbox Blip" transition effect as an envelope.

### V0.0.3
Changed the chip wave, test, into Heavy Saw.
Fixed "Modbox Trill" envelope and made it more accurate. Thanks to Leo for the help on this.
Edited a few sliders to have more freedom.
Added the "Xylophone Saw" as a preset.
Added a few new strum chord types of varying speeds.

### V0.0.4
Added a plethora of new presets!
Added the "energetic" unison.
Changed most important mentions of Beepbox into Midbox.
Added 3 new vibrato types. Aqua, Aqua Delayed, and Drunk.

## There are a few more things, however, I will attempt to do this on Jummbox instead since it is probably better to work there for the amount of new options. I have to find out how to do this though so it will take a while.
